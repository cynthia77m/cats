    <pa>Kittens should be feed around four times a day, while older cats should be 
    feed around two to three times a day. If your cat is feral, it may spend a lot
    of time hiding, which means creating a feeding schedule may be tricky. Leave out
    dry food, and clean water, and give your cat plenty of space. If it feels safe it will come
    out to eat.</p>

    <div id="routine">
        <h2>Maintaince</h2>
          <p>You should brush your cat once a day, and invest in a lint roller. If your cat is an outdoor cat, (strongly discouraged)
          you should also give your cat a bath at least once a month, and check for fleas.

        <h2>Body Language</h2>
        <p> Swishing tail means leave me alone, it is the first warning sign a cat gives.
        After the tail switching depending on the cat it may either walk away, hiss or attack.
         If the body is arched it is scared.</p>
